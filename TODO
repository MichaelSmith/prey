-On Windows allow the guest account to become active if stolen-this takes care of the previous 2 cases for Windows
- Enable auto-login in Mac/Linux/Windows if computer is in stolen state.
- Create an "accesible" user account so that we can lurk the thief into logging in and opening his mail or whatever (and catch him whole handed)
- La idea es que durante el proceso de recolección de datos, también se adjunte en el email un pequeño volcado de los paquetes TCP que se hayan generado mientras el ladrón navega por internet. tcpdump/wireshark > tcpxtract (Idea de Salamander).

POSSIBLE MODULES
